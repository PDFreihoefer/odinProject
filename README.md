## Time Tracking
I started the Odin Project in November 2022. I am currently working as an "Engineering Analyst" for a metal and composite manufacturing company. I have been working with the information systems at the company and have learned SQL to help with DBAing and BI reporting. I have recognized the desire to learn more about computer science and build skills that can be used to further my existing position or to branch out into another career.
