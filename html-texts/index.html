        <h1>Paragraphs with bold and italic text</h1>
        
        <!-- now the <strong> tag can make words look strong-->
        <p> This is the text that I really <strong>like</strong> and all
        other text is just <strong>inferior</strong> to this text.</p>
        
        <!-- now I should add some <em> text -->
        <p> This the text that you should <em>care about</em> because it
        tells <b>you</b> all the of the <em>secret answers</em> to the questions
        of life</p>

        <!-- There are two equivalent tags called <b> for "bold" and <i>
            for "italic". However, we shouldn't use these because of
            accessibility on a website. Strong and Em tell a user using
            a screen reader about the text. A strong text has a "strong"
            meaning. Imagine if you were blind and someone said the text
            was "b" or "bold". It doesn't mean that the text is particularly
            brave, so if we use "strong" then it gives them an idea to the
            connotation of the text-->
